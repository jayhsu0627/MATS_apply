However, they have several key differences:\n\n**Structure:**\n\n* **Sugar:** DNA contains deoxyribose sugar, while RNA contains ribose sugar. The difference lies in the presence of an oxygen atom at the 2' carbon of ribose, which is absent in deoxyribose.\n* **Bases:** Both DNA and RNA use four nitrogenous bases, but they differ in one:",
      "reasoning": "The response provides a clear and technical explanation of the differences between DNA and RNA, but it does not use any analogies or concrete examples. It does, however, use some mapping structure by listing the specific differences in sugar and bases, which helps to organize the information in a way that is somewhat easier to understand. However, it still primarily adheres to a strict scientific definition style."

      "reasoning": "The response uses some analogy elements, such as 'imagine a twisted ladder' and 'like a blueprint,' but it is still heavily mixed with technical terms and definitions. The overall style is a blend of analogy and strict scientific definition, making it a moderate use of analogies."

It also includes concrete examples (library book, twisted ladder) and uses analogy words like 'imagine' and 'think of it as'. However, it is not as well-developed as a score 5, as it does not fully elaborate on the analogy in the second part of the response."
