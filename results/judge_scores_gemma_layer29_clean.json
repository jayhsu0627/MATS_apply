      "reasoning": "The response uses some analogy elements, such as describing DNA as a 'twisted ladder,' but it is still primarily technical and uses scientific terms. It does not fully map technical concepts to familiar, everyday examples, and the overall style is a mix of analogy and strict definition."

However, it also includes a significant amount of technical detail, such as the structure of DNA and RNA, which is presented in a more scientific style. This mix of analogy and technical information results in a moderate use of analogies, placing it at a score of 3."
